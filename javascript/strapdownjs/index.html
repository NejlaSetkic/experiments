Instant and elegant Markdown documents.

Strapdown.js makes it embarrassingly simple to create elegant Markdown documents. **No server-side compilation required.** Use it to quickly document your projects, create tutorials, home pages, etc. (For example, the page you are reading was generated by Strapdown).

Simply type Markdown in your HTML document and drop it on any static file server.
