### Abstract Class

Go tries to distance itself from object-oriented terminology. How to implement an abstract class in Go?
Go doesn't allow fields in interfaces. Is it possible to have some kind of default implementation for a method in Go?

The examples in this module explore that. Code referenced was from this [article by Adrian Witas](https://medium.com/@adrianwit/abstract-class-reinvented-with-go-4a7326525034). Thanks.
